Imagine you're building a simple system to manage student records—nothing fancy, but something that gets the job done efficiently. This program is like a little digital notebook where you can add, update, search for, and delete student details, and it keeps everything neatly stored in a file so you don’t lose the data when you close the program.
At its heart, the code revolves around a Student structure, which holds three basic pieces of information:
- Roll Number – A unique identifier for each student.
- Name – Because knowing just numbers isn't enough.
- Marks – A simple way to track performance.
The real magic happens in five core functions, each designed for a specific task:
- Adding a student: You enter their details, and the program writes them into a file (students.dat) so they’re stored for later use.
- Displaying all students: It reads the file and prints every record neatly. No frills, just pure functionality.
- Searching for a student: Ever lost track of someone? This function finds a student by their roll number and shows their name and marks.
- Updating a record: Maybe someone misspelled their name or their marks need correcting—this function lets you fix that.
- Deleting a student: If a record is no longer needed, it gets removed, making room for fresh data.
And all of this is controlled through a menu-driven system, so the user just picks an option (like "1" to add a student, "2" to display records, etc.). The program keeps running until you decide to exit. It’s straightforward, practical, and does exactly what’s expected.
